# MyNews

MyNews is a simple News search, powered by [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

To run the app, simply go [here](https://nameless-depths-89795.herokuapp.com/) and select a news source to search!

### Running Tests

* Tests are written with Jest and Enzyme.
* To run the test suite, please clone this repository and open the my-news directory in your terminal.
* Run 'yarn test' to start the test suite and then hit 'a' to run all tests.
* At present, tests only confirm that all components and their child components render.
* In a future version, I hope to add testing for props and mock interactions with the input field.

### Desired Changes for Next Version

* Ability to search for articles using a specific keyword
* Ability to search by category
* Improved user interface with ability to open articles simply by clicking the table row 

### Technologies used: 

* JavaScript, React and [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [React-Bootstrap-Table2](https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2) for user interface
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and JavaScript async/await functionality for API calls
